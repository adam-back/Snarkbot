# Snarkbot
This was a project for CS530 at Drexel University.

# Goal #
The purpose of this application is to help users get suggestions for good responses when insulted

# Users #
Ideal users for this application would be elementary or middle school children. Further, the app is designed for kids who deal with adversity in life. Because of the nature of users being bullied, I wanted to make the user interface not embarrass the kids further by making its goal obvious to potential bullies peeking at a kidâ€™s phone.

# How to Run #
 1. Download all files in the repository
 2. Run the Snarkbot.html file in any browser
